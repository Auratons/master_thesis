% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Visual localization is the problem of estimating the 6~degrees of freedom
(DoF) camera pose from which a query image was taken relative to a known
reference scene representation. It is the key for applications such as
Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality, as well as autonomous robotics
such as drones or self-driving cars.

This thesis focuses on the pose verification and ranking step of a visual
localization pipeline that uses 3D point clouds and 2D-3D correspondences
between the query image and 3D scene points for candidate camera poses
estimations. The thesis explores point cloud rendering approaches as they
are utilized in the verification step – the render of the discretized
scene from a given candidate position is compared to the actual query
image to asses if the given couple depicts the same place.

One of the main challenges of such rendering is occlusion handling. Due
to the sparsity of points employed for otherwise continuous real world
representation, information about what lies in the front and what is
hidden can be easily lost when projected to the 2D image. Rendering
approaches explored in this thesis focus on the challenge directly or
as a component for training a novel view synthesis DNN-based renderer.
Rendering influence on localization performance is investigated.
